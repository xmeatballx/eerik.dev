# How I use NixOS as a daily driver

Status: Rough Draft

# Laptop

## TLP

Compared to its well known counterparts, Linux can drain a laptop battery pretty quickly. Thankfully the NixOS website provides example configurations for many common laptop models. Many of them feature some variation of this TLP setup, which allows you to throttle CPU performance to preserve battery life when not charging, and alter charging behavior to improve the battery longevity. 

```nix
  services.tlp = {
      enable = true;
      settings = {
        CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC = "performance";
        CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT = "powersave";

        CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_BAT = "power";
        CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC = "performance";

        CPU_MIN_PERF_ON_AC = 0;
        CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_AC = 100;
        CPU_MIN_PERF_ON_BAT = 0;
        CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_BAT = 20;

       #Optional helps save long term battery health
       START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0 = 40; # 40 and bellow it starts to charge
       STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0 = 80; # 80 and above it stops charging

      };
  };

```

## Graphics

Also found in the common nix configurations is this graphics configuration. My laptop provides a virtual intel graphics card that runs on the CPU and an Nvidia graphics card. Depending on the setup you chose, you can utilize one or the other or both in varying ways. I chose the prime offloading setup, which allows you to offload certain applications to the Nvidia GPU. I don‚Äôt do a lot of gaming etc, I mostly have found the offloading useful for hardware accelerated terminals and browsers which do a lot rendering and can clog up the CPU.

```nix
  hardware.nvidia = {
    modesetting.enable = true;
    package = config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidiaPackages.stable;
    powerManagement.enable = true;
    open = false;
    prime = {
      offload = {
        enable = true;
        enableOffloadCmd = true;
      };
      intelBusId = "PCI:0:2:0";
      nvidiaBusId = "PCI:1:0:0";
    };
  };

```

## Theme

High level theming is so straightforward in Nix I love it!

### GTK theme

The catppuccin GTK theme can be included as a package in home-manager

```nix
home.packages = with pkgs; [    
    (catppuccin-gtk.override {
      size = "compact";
      tweaks = [ "rimless" "black" ]; # You can also specify multiple tweaks here
      variant = "mocha";
    })
];
```

### Background

To set the background an image just needs to be added to the home directory with the name ‚Äú.background-image‚Äù

```nix
  home.file = {
    ".background-image" = {
      source = "${wallpaper}";
    };
  };
```

### Global Colors

Having a global colors.nix file can be super helpful, often different aspects of a system like window managers, terminals, etc. will require different theme configurations, but as long as you can configure them from Nix (which you most likely can) you can apply your global color theme just by importing colors.nix and using the variables

```nix
{
  rosewater = "#f5e0dc";
  peach = "#fab387";
  lavender = "#b4befe";
  green = "#a6e3a1";
  blue = "#89b4fa";
  text = "#cdd6f4";
  overlay0 = "#6c7086";
  surface1 = "#45475a";
  base = "#1e1e2e";
}

```

## i3

### Base config

After doing a few i3 custom builds in VM‚Äôs, I found it pretty annoying to navigate my huge tmux.conf file to find a specific declaration. Co-locating keybindings with the theme and i3status gets out of hand so fast. Splitting different concerns into files which get imported helps me find things much quicker and lets me scale my config without worrying about bloating my monolithic config file.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  imports = [
    ./keybindings.nix
    ./colors.nix
    ./bar.nix
    ./i3status.nix
    ./startup.nix
  ];
    
  xsession.windowManager.i3 = {
    enable = true;
    config = {
      terminal = "kitty";
      gaps = {
        inner = 5;
        outer = 1;
        smartGaps = true;
      };
      focus = {
        newWindow = "focus";
      };
    };
    extraConfig = ''
      for_window [class="Google-chrome"] border pixel 0
    '';
  };
}

```

### Keybindings

I didnt include most of my keybindings in this snippet 1. because they‚Äôre mostly default and 2. because its a subject people are very opinionated  and I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion, I just set it up in a way that felt good. But it is worth noting that with the xev package, you can find the name of any non-standard key on your laptop keyboard. Here I set up my volume and brightness keys to function normally.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
let 
  mod = "Mod4";
in
{
  xsession.windowManager.i3.config.modifier = "Mod4";
  xsession.windowManager.i3.config.keybindings = with pkgs; {
		...
    "XF86AudioLowerVolume" = "exec pamixer -d 5";
    "XF86AudioRaiseVolume" = "exec pamixer -i 5";
    "XF86AudioMute" = "exec pamixer -t";

    "XF86MonBrightnessUp" = "exec brightnessctl set 10%+";
    "XF86MonBrightnessDown" = "exec brightnessctl set 10%- -n 100";
  };
}
```

### i3status

Not much to say about this besides look at that declarative beauty. I much prefer this to the standard i3status syntax. I find this to be a completely reasonable status bar for laptop use

```nix
{config, ...}:

{
  programs.i3status = {
    enable = true;
    enableDefault = false;
    modules = {
      "tztime local" = {
        position = 1;
        settings = {
          format = "%I:%M%p %m/%d/%Y";
        };
      };
      "volume master" = {
        position = 2;
        settings = {
          format = "‚ô™ %volume";
          format_muted = "‚ô™ muted (%volume)";
          device = "default";
        };
      };
      "battery all" = {
        position = 3;
        settings = {
          format = "%status %percentage";
          status_bat = "üîã";
          status_chr = "‚ö°";
          status_full = "‚òª";
          status_unk = "?";
        };
      };
      "wireless _first_" = {
        position = 4;
        settings = {
          format_down = "no wifi";
          format_up = "%ip";
        };
      };
    };
  };
}

```

## Neovim

This tip comes on behalf of the awesome Vimjoyer youtube channel. Many of the Nix docs recommend adding extra config to packages via a string template. Some people prefer this approach as it keeps everything in Nix, however in the case of Neovim I find it much more convenient to do via Lua file as that‚Äôs pretty much the expected workflow. It‚Äôs possible to define a few small nix functions in the let block which can convert a string of Lua code or a path to a lua file into a Nix friendly template string.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, lib, ...}:
let
  toLua = str: "lua << EOF\n${str}\nEOF\n";
  toLuaFile = file: "lua << EOF\n${builtins.readFile file}\nEOF\n";
in
{
  programs.neovim = {
    enable = true;
    extraLuaConfig = '' ${builtins.readFile ../config/nvim/init.lua} '';
    extraPackages = with pkgs; [
      cmake
      gcc

      lua-language-server
      rnix-lsp
      nodePackages.typescript-language-server
      nodePackages.svelte-language-server
      efm-langserver
      emmet-ls
      vscode-langservers-extracted
      
      ripgrep
      xclip
      wl-clipboard
    ];

    plugins = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [
      telescope-fzf-native-nvim
      neo-tree-nvim
      bufferline-nvim
      comment-nvim
      efmls-configs-nvim
      vim-tmux-navigator
      cmp-buffer
      cmp-path
      luasnip
      cmp_luasnip
      friendly-snippets
      
      {
        plugin = vim-sleuth;
        config = toLua "require(\'bufferline\').setup()";
      }
      {
        plugin = indent-blankline-nvim;
        config = toLua "require(\'ibl\').setup()";
      }
      {
        plugin = telescope-nvim;
        config = toLuaFile ../config/nvim/plugins/telescope.lua;
      }
      {
        plugin = nvim-lspconfig;
        config = toLuaFile ../config/nvim/plugins/lsp.lua;
      }
      {
        plugin = nvim-cmp;
        config = toLuaFile ../config/nvim/plugins/cmp.lua;
      }
      {
        plugin = (nvim-treesitter.withPlugins (p: [
          p.tree-sitter-nix
          p.tree-sitter-vim
          p.tree-sitter-bash
          p.tree-sitter-lua
          p.tree-sitter-python
          p.tree-sitter-json
          p.tree-sitter-css

          p.tree-sitter-javascript
          p.tree-sitter-typescript
          p.tree-sitter-svelte
        ]));
        config = toLuaFile ../config/nvim/plugins/treesitter.lua;
      }
      {
        plugin = catppuccin-nvim;
        config = "colorscheme catppuccin-mocha";
      }
    ];
    viAlias = true;
    vimAlias = true;
    vimdiffAlias = true;
  };
}

```

## Tmux

Shoutout vim-tmux-navigator!

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  programs.tmux = {
    enable = true;
    mouse = true;
    keyMode = "vi";
    prefix = "C-Space";
    plugins = with pkgs; [
      tmuxPlugins.catppuccin
      tmuxPlugins.vim-tmux-navigator 
    ];
    extraConfig = '' unbind C-. '';
  };
}

```

## Apps

In other linux distros, heck even on mac and windows, I find it really difficult to keep track of whats installed. I‚Äôve had countless experiences where in an urgent debugging frenzy installed a bunch of random packages which may or may not help me solve my problem, and then completely forget they exist. Or I‚Äôll end up with 2 or 3 local media players etc. Even on Arch, which prides itself on allowing for lightweight minimal configs, doesn‚Äôt give you this sort observability re: whats installed and you ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù system can quickly get out of hand. There‚Äôs something to be said for being able to see all your users installed packages/applications in one place and be able to pick and choose the right tool for each use case.

```nix
  home.packages = with pkgs; [

    kitty #terminal
    neofetch #obligatory
    btop #htop but pretty
    du-dust #disk usage but pretty
    bat #cat but pretty

    brightnessctl #control backlight
    dunst #notification daemon
    pavucontrol #sound settings GUI
    lxappearance #app theming

    image-roll #image viewer

    google-chrome 
    spotify
    spotify-tray #add spotify to i3status
    jellyfin-media-player
    inkscape #svg editor
    strawberry #local music player
    haruna #local video player

    slack
    discord

    redis
    mongodb-compass
    typescript
    bruno #free software Postman alternative

  ];

```

## Scripts

With home manager you can include a shell script as a package that generates an executable binary. Some scripts I know I‚Äôll always want associated with my user, and being able to do that in a declarative way is very convenient

### Reconfig

I got the idea for this from a Librephoenix youtube video. One thing you find yourself doing a lot in NixOS, especially as you‚Äôre getting started is edit and rebuild your configuration. This script opens my NixOS configuration in Neovim. When I finish editing the config, I see a git diff including all of the changes I made. From there the configuration rebuilds, I opted to suppress the verbose build output and only show errors if they are encountered to prevent too much visual noise. If the home-manager and system configurations both successfully build, the changes are committed to a git repository.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  home.packages = [
    (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "reconfig" ''
           function showProgress() {
             local command="$1"
             local commonName="$2"
             local FRAMES="/ | \\ -"
             local status=0
             local pid=0

             if [ $commonName == "System" ]; then
               read -s -p "Enter sudo password: " sudo_password
               #echo "$sudo_password" | 
               sudo -S $command <<< $sudo_password &> nixos-switch.log || (cat nixos-switch.log | grep --color error && false) & pid=$!
             else
               $command &> nixos-switch.log || (cat nixos-switch.log | grep --color error && false) & pid=$!
             fi

             while ps -p $pid > /dev/null; do
                   for frame in $FRAMES; do
                       printf "\r$frame Syncing $commonName configuration..."
                       sleep 0.2
                   done
                   if ! kill -0 $pid 2>/dev/null; then
                       wait $pid
                       status=$?
                       break
                   fi
               done

               if [ $status -eq 0 ]; then
                   printf "\r$GREEN‚úì$NC Syncing $commonName configuration...$GREEN [Success!]$NC\n"
               else
                   printf "\r$RED√ó$NC Syncing $commonName configuration...$RED [Failed!]$NC\n"
               fi
               printf "\n"
           }

           pushd ~/nixos-dotfiles &> /dev/null
           nvim .
           git diff -U0
           git add .
           showProgress "home-manager switch --flake .#meatball" "Home-Manager"
           showProgress "nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-laptop" "System"
           rm nixos-switch.log
           gen=$(nixos-rebuild list-generations | grep current);
           git commit -am "$gen"
           popd &> /dev/null
    '')
  ];
}

```
